      "message": "You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFormat your response as JSON with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?\",\n  \"plan\": \"Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.\",\n  \"commands\": [\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"ls -la\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    },\n    {\n      \"keystrokes\": \"cd project\\n\",\n      \"duration\": 0.1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"task_complete\": true\n}\n\nRequired fields:\n- \"analysis\": Your analysis of the current situation\n- \"plan\": Your plan for the next steps\n- \"commands\": Array of command objects to execute\n\nOptional fields:\n- \"task_complete\": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)\n\nCommand object structure:\n- \"keystrokes\": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)\n- \"duration\": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)\n\nIMPORTANT: The text inside \"keystrokes\" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:\n- Most bash commands should end with a newline (\\n) to cause them to execute\n- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:\n  - C-c for Ctrl+C\n  - C-d for Ctrl+D\n\nThe \"duration\" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.\n\nIt is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {\"keystrokes\": \"\", \"duration\": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal\n- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command\n- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated\n- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings\n- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action\n\nTask Description:\n\nServer virtualization is a big thing these days, so I'm tasked at work to install some of our software on a virtualized server and see what happens. Long story short: a rsync transfer promptly brings the virtualized server to its knees. The virtualization host is a beefy machine with no other load; I don't think this should be happening. Top shows high load averages, and cpu iowait near 100%. There's a huge bottleneck somewhere. I'm more a programmer than a sysadmin, I lack the knowledge on how to go about fixing this outside of random Googling. I suspect I'm not alone in this. What I'd like to see here is general advice on virtualization, and pointers to good articles and other resources, which I and others could use to educate ourselves. What tools (even standard unix tools) can be used to pinpoint bottlenecks? What metrics should be followed to ensure things run smoothly? What kind of things can be efficiently virtualized? What kind of setups are doomed to fail? I apologize the broadness of the question. I just don't have the knowledge to ask useful specific questions about this. Edit: More on my specific problem: XAN paravirtualization, 3 x guest CentOS All guests on local SCSI disks, there is a fully hardware raid controller rsyncd running on 1 guest os, transfer initiated from a remote non virtualized server through 100mbps LAN Like I said before, I really can't provide a ton of useful data. I'm not really expecting to get a direct solution to this problem, I'd be happy with pointers on where to start building the skillset required to better understand these kinds of problems.\n\n\nCurrent terminal state:\nCurrent Terminal Screen:\nroot@4279d869-51d7-4f2a-8aa0-2ca890e7e93f:/app#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

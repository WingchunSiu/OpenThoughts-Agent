You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- Most bash commands should end with a newline (\n) to cause them to execute
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:

Im just writing a small Ajax framework for re-usability in small projects and i've hit a problem. Basically i get a ' NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE ' error while sending the request and i've no idea what is happening. The HTML Page (trimmed but shows the error) Ajax Test var COMPLETE = 4; var OK = 200; function GetXMLHttpRequestObject() { var XMLHttpRequestObject = false; if(window.XMLHttpRequest) { if(typeof XMLHttpRequest != 'undefined') { try { XMLHttpRequestObject = new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch (e) { XMLHttpRequestObject = false; } } } else if (window.ActiveXObject) { try { XMLHttpRequestObject = new ActiveXObject('Msxml2.XMLHTTP'); } catch (e) { try { XMLHttpRequestObject = new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP'); } catch (e) { XMLHttpRequestObject = false; } } } else { XMLHttpRequestObject = false; } return XMLHttpRequestObject; } //The Main Ajax Object function AjaxRequest(p_RequestMethod, p_DestinationURL) { this.XMLHttpRequestObject = GetXMLHttpRequestObject(); this.RequestedMethod = p_RequestMethod; this.DestinationURL = p_DestinationURL; this.XMLHttpRequestObject.open(this.RequestMethod, this.DestinationURL); this.OnStateChange = function(Callback) { this.XMLHttpRequestObject.onreadystatechange = Callback; } this.Send = function(p_Content) { this.XMLHttpRequestObject.send(p_Content); } this.GetState() { return this.XMLHttpRequestObject.readyState; } this.GetResponseText = function() { return this.XMLHttpRequestObject.responseText; } this.GetResponseStatus = function() { return this.XMLHttpRequestObject.status; } this.GetResponseStatusText = function() { return this.XMLHttpRequestObject.statusText; } } var Request; function GetData() { Request = new AjaxRequest('POST', 'http://www.kalekold.net/ajax/Ajax.php'); Request.OnStateChange = StateChange; Request.Send(); } function StateChange() { window.alert("State: " + Request.GetState()); window.alert("Response: " + Request.GetResponseStatus()); window.alert("Response Text: " + Request.GetResponseStatusText()); if(Request.GetState() == COMPLETE && Request.GetResponseStatus() == OK) { Result = Request.GetResponseText(); window.alert(Result); } } The PHP File: PROLOG; $XML .= " "; $XML .= " "; $XML .= " Gary "; $XML .= " Willoughby "; $XML .= " 35 "; $XML .= " "; $XML .= " "; $XML .= " Sara "; $XML .= " Gostick "; $XML .= " 35 "; $XML .= " "; $XML .= " "; header("Content-Type: text/xml"); echo $XML; ?> The full error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsIXMLHttpRequest.open]" nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)" location: "JS frame :: http://www.kalekold.net/ajax/ :: AjaxRequest :: line 63" data: no] Line 0 I just can't see where it's going wrong, any ideas?

You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- Most bash commands should end with a newline (\n) to cause them to execute
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:

In the Apple documentation for NSRunLoop there is sample code demonstrating suspending execution while waiting for a flag to be set by something else. BOOL shouldKeepRunning = YES; // global NSRunLoop *theRL = [NSRunLoop currentRunLoop]; while (shouldKeepRunning && [theRL runMode:NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate:[NSDate distantFuture]]); I have been using this and it works but in investigating a performance issue I tracked it down to this piece of code. I use almost exactly the same piece of code (just the name of the flag is different :) and if I put a NSLog on the line after the flag is being set (in another method) and then a line after the while() there is a seemingly random wait between the two log statements of several seconds. The delay does not seem to be different on slower or faster machines but does vary from run to run being at least a couple of seconds and up to 10 seconds. I have worked around this issue with the following code but it does not seem right that the original code doesn't work. NSDate *loopUntil = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:0.1]; while (webViewIsLoading && [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runMode: NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate:loopUntil]) loopUntil = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:0.1]; using this code, the log statements when setting the flag and after the while loop are now consistently less than 0.1 seconds apart. Anyone any ideas why the original code exhibits this behaviour?

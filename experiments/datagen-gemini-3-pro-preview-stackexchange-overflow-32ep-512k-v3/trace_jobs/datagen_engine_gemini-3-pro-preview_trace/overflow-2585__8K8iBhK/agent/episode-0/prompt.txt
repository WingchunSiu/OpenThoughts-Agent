You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- Most bash commands should end with a newline (\n) to cause them to execute
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:

Currently I run an classic (old) ASP webpage with recordset object used directly in bad old spagethi code fasion. I'm thinking of implementing a data layer in asp.net as web serivce to improve manageability. This is also a first step towards upgrading the website to asp.net. The site itself remains ASP for the moment... Can anybody recommend a good way of replacing the recordset object type with a web service compatible type (like an array or something)? What do I replace below with?: set objRS = oConn.execute(SQL) while not objRS.eof ... name = Cstr(objRS(1)) ... wend and also mutliple recordsets can be replaced with? I'm talking : set objRS = objRs.nextRecordset Anybody went through this and can recommend? @AdditionalInfo - you asked for it :-) Let me start at the beginning. Existing Situation is : I have an old ASP website with classical hierachical content (header, section, subsection, content) pulled out of database via stored procedures and content pages are in database also (a link to html file). Now bad thing is, ASP code everywhere spread over many .asp files all doing their own database connections, reading, writing (u have to register for content). Recently we had problems with SQL injection attacks so I was called to fix it. I could go change all the .asp pages to prevent sql injection but that would be madness. So I thought build a data layer - all pages using this layer to access database. Once place to fix and update db access code. Coming to that decision I thought asp.net upgrade isn'f far away, why not start using asp.net for the data layer? This way it can be re-used when upgrading the site. That brings me to the questions above!

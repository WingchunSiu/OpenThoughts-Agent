You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- Most bash commands should end with a newline (\n) to cause them to execute
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:

First post, so here goes. I'm writing a script that does intelligent search and replace on a file tree. Essentially, the script gets each file's contents into a buffer string and performs a match with a pre-defined pattern, in this case the pattern is /^[^\r\n]*(vendor)[^\r\n]*$/im . The pattern should find any case-insensitive forms of "vendor" and give me the entire line that was matched. I need to see the whole line in order to determine whether or not to replace the occurrence. This pattern performs well for any number of separate line occurences in a given file. However, if there are multiple occurrences on a given line, the pattern will only match one of those occurrences, and skip the others. I'm trying to determine if I need to have a second pattern to do additional searching on the matched line, or if I can accomplish this purpose with a single pattern that does all of the above. Just a sample of what I'm hoping to produce. An example of a single line, multi-occurrence match: Enthusiastically revolutionize web-enabled VENDOR potentialities vendors installed base e-tailers. I would like to output something similar to this (again, the ouput isn't the issue here, it's whether or not I can match it all with one pattern): Multiple occurrences in line: || Enthusiastically revolutionize web-enabled VENDOR potentialities vendors installed base e-tailers. || Replace? (y,n,q) || ...abled VENDOR poten... || Replace? (y,n,q) || ...ties vendors insta... || Please let me know if I am unclear on my objective. Thanks for any help and response to this!

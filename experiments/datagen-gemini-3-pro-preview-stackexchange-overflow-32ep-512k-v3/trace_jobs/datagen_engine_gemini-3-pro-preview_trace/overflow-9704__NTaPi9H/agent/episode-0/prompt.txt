You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task description and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:

{
  "analysis": "Analyze the current state based on the terminal output provided. What do you see? What has been accomplished? What still needs to be done?",
  "plan": "Describe your plan for the next steps. What commands will you run and why? Be specific about what you expect each command to accomplish.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "ls -la\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    },
    {
      "keystrokes": "cd project\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "task_complete": true
}

Required fields:
- "analysis": Your analysis of the current situation
- "plan": Your plan for the next steps
- "commands": Array of command objects to execute

Optional fields:
- "task_complete": Boolean indicating if the task is complete (defaults to false if not present)

Command object structure:
- "keystrokes": String containing the exact keystrokes to send to the terminal (required)
- "duration": Number of seconds to wait for the command to complete before the next command will be executed (defaults to 1.0 if not present)

IMPORTANT: The text inside "keystrokes" will be used completely verbatim as keystrokes. Write commands exactly as you want them sent to the terminal:
- Most bash commands should end with a newline (\n) to cause them to execute
- For special key sequences, use tmux-style escape sequences:
  - C-c for Ctrl+C
  - C-d for Ctrl+D

The "duration" attribute specifies the number of seconds to wait for the command to complete (default: 1.0) before the next command will be executed. On immediate tasks (e.g., cd, ls, echo, cat) set a duration of 0.1 seconds. On commands (e.g., gcc, find, rustc) set a duration of 1.0 seconds. On slow commands (e.g., make, python3 [long running script], wget [file]) set an appropriate duration as you determine necessary.

It is better to set a smaller duration than a longer duration. It is always possible to wait again if the prior output has not finished, by running {"keystrokes": "", "duration": 10.0} on subsequent requests to wait longer. Never wait longer than 60 seconds; prefer to poll to see intermediate result status.

Important notes:
- Each command's keystrokes are sent exactly as written to the terminal
- Do not include extra whitespace before or after the keystrokes unless it's part of the intended command
- Extra text before or after the JSON will generate warnings but be tolerated
- The JSON must be valid - use proper escaping for quotes and special characters within strings
- Commands array can be empty if you want to wait without taking action

Task Description:

I have an SQL Server DB with a table with these fields: A bit with the default value 1, NOT NULL . A smalldatetime with the default value gettime() , NOT NULL . An int with no default value, IDENTITY , NOT NULL . When I generate Linq to SQL for this table, the following happens: The bit is given no special treatment. The smalldatetime is given no special treatment. The int is marked as IsDbGenerated . This means that when I make inserts using Linq to SQL, the following will happen: The bit will be sent as 0, overriding the default value. Right? The smalldatetime will be sent as an uninitialized System.DateTime , producing an error in SQL server since it doesn't fall with the SQL Server smalldatetime range. Right? The IsDbGenerated int will not be sent; the DB will generate a value which Linq to SQL will then read back. What changes do I have to make to make this scenario work? To summarize: I want non-nullable fields with DB-assigned default values, but I don't want them IsDbGenerated if it means I cannot provide values for them when making updates or inserts using Linq to SQL. I also do not want them IsDbGenerated if it means I have to hand-modify the code generated by Linq to SQL. EDIT: The answer seems to be this is a limitation in the current Linq to SQL.

It should be possible to add these other controllers so that the main controller does not have to be aware of their existence. I was planning to use routes like \"x/{*path}/y\" to index these aspects but the routing system will not accept such paths. I could use a constraint to only match my additional routes if the path parameter ends in \"/y\" for example but then the controller would have to be aware of the \"extension\" added to be able to remove it when parsing the path - this is not acceptable.
